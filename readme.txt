Add a shortcode that allows to display content parts to logged in or non-logged in users. Also includes integration with visual composer.

== Description ==
This plugin allows to display content sections only to logged in users, or only to non-logged in users.

After activating the plugin use the shortcode [member_container] to encapsulate the content you want to show exclusively to members or non members. For example:
[member_container show="non-members"] Join now! [/member_container]

The shortcode has only one parameter:
- show: Determines the kind of user that is the content for. Possible values are: "members", "non-members".

If you have Visual Composer installed, an element called "(non) Member Container" will appear under the category "Content", when it is inserted you can choose if the content will be for members or non members

[The plugin is available in Github](https://github.com/Webilop/member-content-visibility). We receive patches to fix bugs and translation files.
